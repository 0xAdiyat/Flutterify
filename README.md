Flutterify makes it easy to create and deploy Flutter projects. Here are some common commands and examples:

### Create a New Flutter Project

To create a new Flutter project using Flutterify, use the following command:

```shell
python3 flutterify.py
```
you can also create your `own allies` incase to avoid writting the whole command,for me it was `fc` 

Choose `my_flutter_app` with your desired project name. This command will set up a new Flutter project with a recommended project structure.

# Set 'fc' as an alias for Flutterify
alias fc="flutterify"

# To open the project in Android Studio, use:
fc --android-studio `coming soon`

# To open the project in Visual Studio Code, use:
fc --vscode `coming soon`
